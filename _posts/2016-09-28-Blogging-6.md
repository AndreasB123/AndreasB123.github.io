    <td>Now I can do this.  With the help of one Mr Keen (who emailed a response to my earlier blog using the email ican at the bottom of the page - muchos gracias!) I got my first embed working.  </td>

  <tr>
    <td>You have to go to the actual post in GitHub and edit the html using the embed codes from YouTube by clicking "Share".  You can set all sorts of neat parameter such as width and whether the suggested other videos display.  All this is explained in the YouTube video that I have embedded - HOW COOL IS THAT!</td>

  <tr>
    <td>To add extra unification, I went back into my .scss and created an ”iframe” section and added my drop shadow to lift it off the page.  I also tried adding the border radius, but this was a bit temperamental, so I took it off.  Anyway, there's no disguising that it’s a YouTube video  and people are expecting to see squared off edges, so I’m not actually that fussed...</td>
