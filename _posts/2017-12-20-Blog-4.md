He's Back - Maintenance

In today's lesson we had our teacher back and teaching us. He was interested in our blogs and when I logged on to mine I found that it had many errors - as in this was it:

[Computer!?](http://andreasb.github.io/)

I eventually discovered the problem and it was to do with the domain name and which blog I had assigned my documents to. I had to click on settings (on my github name) and change the name to something different as I had accidentally been using a "test'â€™ blog/ practice one.

The rest of the lesson was spent on me performing trial and error up until then, of course.
