Saying goodbye

Today was our final and very last lesson, in google spreadsheets and we will be starting a new topic next lesson- alongside a new teacher (that I've had before). Today’s lesson i finished up on my virtual shop and I also showed my online shop - via the app TicTail which I have been using prior to getting involved with sheets, Sir and I had a lengthy chat about the ins and outs of my shop, as well as it’s functions, details and efficiency in mathematics which was in order to work out prices and packaging. If only I had learnt the google sheets method earlier then I would have had a field day instead of multiple hours of itching calculations.

You can check out my website here: [Casual Essentials](https://tictail.com/casualessentials)

Also my inefficient mathematical workings: TICTAIL.

Product Stock

Earphones with a microphone.

Product buy 1.56 for supply.

Tictail needs 20% of all earnings.

Product sell 

Due to TicTail's large involvement we need to account for a 20% loss of profit.

Math1-Structure 

20% of the 1.56 is 0.312 as TT demands a 20% share of earnings. Meaning if we bought and sold our product for the same price we would lose this amount (0.312.)

To actually make profit we have to account for a final 20% loss as well as an extra 1.56 pounds which we spent on buying the stock/pre product, we can now use this as a template for the final market value/price.

£?-£1.56=£?-20%=+£?

Math2-Price testing Product strictly

For a single amount of the product⬇️

1st

£2.0 

2-1.56=0.44

20% of 0.44= 0.088

That goes toward Tictail (TT) and the remaining 0.352 goes to me.

2nd

£2.79

2.79-1.56=1.23

20% of 1.23=0.246

0.246=TT

0.984=Me

3rd

£3.10

3.10-1.56=1.54

20% of 1.54=0.308

0.308=TT

1.232=Me

4th

£3.56

3.56-1.56=2.0

20% of 2.0=0.40

0.40=TT

1.60=Me  

Math3-With postage 

3 day delivery is 56p

1 day delivery is 65p

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/f3VekPy7n5sZATNx1Pnizw_img_1.png)

2nd option test for both deliveries 

profit=0.984 - 0.56 (postage)=0.424 profit to me.

profit=0.984 - 0.65 (postage)=0.334 profit to me.

4th option test for both deliveries

profit=1.60 - 0.56=1.04 profit for me.

profit=1.60 - 0.65=0.95 profit to me.

PREFER 3 DAY DELIVERY 

10x the amount of sales (option 4)

Cost of one: 1.56(product)+0.40(TT 20%)+0.56(postage cost)=£2.52 spent

3.66(price)-2.52(spent)=£1.14 profit to me

Ten:36.6-25.2=11.14

LESS PREFERRED NEXT DAY DELIVERY (1 DAY)

10x the amount of sales (option 4)

Cost of one: 1.56+0.40+0.65(postage cost)=£2.61 spent

£3.66-2.61=£1.05 profit to me

Ten:£36.6-26.1=10.50
