    <td>We learnt how to set up a Fuse Box by working in pairs. I was working with Kriday and by combining our skills we worked well together. We were effective as a team because we listened to each other's ideas and we're always doing something if it was explaining how to put the USB mouse in or how to start the coding. We learnt how to set up a fuze Box but, more importantly, how to work as a pair. Knowing how to work with other people is extremely important. This is because, in later life, you will  be working with people and it is important you work well together.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited because it was hard to put all of the fiddly wires in the computer. This limited my learning because it wasted time that we could be coding. Also there was a long queue of people who wanted help so that used up even more time. However, we did manage to complete the target , so,  it wasn't that bad. I need to make sure that I leave the lesson understanding everything and know that it's ok to ask questions that benefit my learning and the learning of my peers. Also,  we need to have self belief so that we don't have to ask for help. We also need to think flexibly so that if we run into a problem we can come up with ideas and sort it out ourselves.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson will hopefully be much more interesting  because we now know how to quickly and easily set up a Fuse box. Next time,  I will try to get more involved and be more helpful to Kriday, this means that we will have more  time. </td>
