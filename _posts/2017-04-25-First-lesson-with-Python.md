We have finally moved over to our final term of computing, and we will be spending it with Mr. Keen. In our first lesson we were introduced to "Python" - not the snake, but a software of which we could learn more complex code. We were shown what to do and,via codecademy, we began going through a tutorial including: strings, variables and most of all punctuality.

These were difficult, and by the end of the lesson we, me and Morgan, had progressed well through them. Although not working together we offered helpful hints - not answers, however hints towards them. Mr. Keen specified this. My homework was to work for a further 30 minutes on this website so that we could grasp the basics of the Python syntax. Question much like this were common, and getting harder!

We used the left column as our instructions. It produced helpful and understandable tips on how to carry out these tasks. The numbered lines were our "paper" - used for typing/writing on.
