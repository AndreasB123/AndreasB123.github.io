  <tr>
    <td> Kriday and I Learnt by Engaging in the subject and being absorbed in it. This helped us understand everything. We collaborated together, Listened to each other and learning from each other. For example, we were improving our code when I said ' To do … we should change … ‘  But Kriday corrected me by saying ‘ no, we actually change .. ‘ This helped us learn a lot. Moreover, we were making links to the other Fuze exercises we had done.We were also constantly keeping track of the time, keeping us organised. We also persevered and though flexibly to get around any problems we had. This lesson, we learnt how to use images to make a image, using the ‘Defchar' command. We also learnt how to change the color of text and the background of it.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>my learning was not limited this lesson, me and Kriday worked really hard and ignored any distractions. We need to work on being resourceful. I f we have a problem, we could ask a teacher, ask a peer or go on the internet to fix it.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>next time I will improve my learning by going back over the code, seeing what I can change to make it better and improving things, adding my own little touch. This means I am not just copying a book, I am writing my own code.</td>
