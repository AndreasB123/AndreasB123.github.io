Back from half-term

Mr. Keen! Our new - yet old I.T. teacher is back and he has set us up with some repl.it work. It seems to be about coding shapes and drawings. We had discussions in between work and he gave us a philosophical question to ponder, which was: How do you think the first shapes were made on computer systems. The answer being with individual pixels which were later programmed into drawing shapes for them and nowadays a button draws a shape/letter or number. The work we did was about solving various problems as we learned to programme the drawing of our shapes, and for homework Mr. Keen wanted a beautiful flower. So I made him one - accidentally as with 360 degree rotational symmetry -  it is quite easy to make flower lookalikes (out of black pixels).

Here is my code and my flower (ignore the "shape_stem" bit):
