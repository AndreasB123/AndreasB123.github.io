Discunots

This week's lesson was all about being introduced to discounts and adding them to our own spreadsheets. This meant that we could apply a  discount whenever we wanted. The type of discount we did depended on the amount of items the customer was buying. In this case I had a 12% discount if you bought all or my items from the shop. Firstly we set up the discount by setting a formula which would multiply the final sum by 0.88 to take 12% off the price. We then made a total box under the quantity column and wrote a formula that said ' if the total quantity is greater than or **equal **to the cell with ‘5’ (all my products)in it then do the sum for 12% off." This allows me to go back and change the amount of items they need to buy in order to get a discount without changing the formula as it will just take whatever number is in the cell at the time. Meaning I could lower the amount of items needed for a discount, possibly due to and event/international sale.
