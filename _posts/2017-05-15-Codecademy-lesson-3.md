    <td>I worked well this lesson. I thought logically  and persevered to complete my  goal; when there was an error in my code, I retraced my steps and saw what was wrong using my noticing skills.  I then applied my past knowledge from one of the other projects and corrected our mistakes. This allowed me to finishthe  pyglatin.
