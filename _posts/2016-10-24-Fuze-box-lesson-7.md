    <td>Kriday and I worked well together. We thought logically  and persevered to complete our goal; when there was an error in our code, we retraced our steps and saw what was wrong using our noticing skills.  We then applied past knowledge from one of the other projects and corrected our mistakes. We were actively listening to each other and listening to ideas. We collaborated together and learnt as a team.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This lesson, my learning was limited when we couldn't put the wires on the fuze box with the electronics kit. It was really fiddly but eventually we did it. This limited our learning because it used a lot of time when we could have been coding. I need to work on being patient because when you aren't patient, you make mistakes.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will improve my learning by being accurate. We make a lot of typing errors, If i slow down and avoid these then it will make us more efficient and achieve more.</td>
