    <td>I had to remember and refamiliarise myself with the features and navigation of GitHub.  I learnt how to edit the config file so that my name, information and an image (or Avatar) would appear. 

In the stylesheet (.scss) I learnt how to change colours of background and type fonts.  I made some horrible combinations - just because I could!</td>

    <td>The first set of instructions went well, although I managed to get confused when the program showed up a slightly different version of the information and I got distracted by menus that weren't relevant.  

This made me change my ways and I decided to take quick notes (on paper) so that I could remember the instructions in the correct order next time.  This strategy helped me a lot, and the next process went really smoothly.</td>
