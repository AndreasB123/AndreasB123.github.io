    <td>Me and kriday learnt by lots of teamwork. We make a great pair. We would listen to each other and discuss our ideas. When something went wrong, e.g we mistyped something, we would thoroughly check our work. We would learn to each other when we make mistakes. We also questioned things and , thus, improved our learning. We also engaged in the subject, helping us understand what it's about.</td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>At the beginning of the lesson, it had turned out that we had previously saved a file as a picture. Luckily, we had our ideas and we saved it again, but as a .fuze file. This limited our learning because it wasted time. However, it made us learn to be more careful and take time.
I need to  work on slowing down and taking more time.</td>
