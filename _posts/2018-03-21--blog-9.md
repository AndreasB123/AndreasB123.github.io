This lesson we turned to python 3, our goal was to make letters, 3 of which were from our name. I struggled during the lesson as I had to make semicircles for a B and D shape, I managed to make an A, with some help from mr.Keen.  i went online and found many tutorials and ways to make the circles and meanwhile I was introduced to the "goto" function. This allows you to make the pen face and start in a certain direction and it is more efficient than constantly rotating. Ironically, all i had problems with was the rotation of my semicircle, as I would rotate it but then the rest of my shape would malfunction and it just wouldn't work with my entire letter/shape.

I attempted to fixthis for homework and I still couldn't solve it.

I plan on going in during lunch I.T. sessions for assistance.
