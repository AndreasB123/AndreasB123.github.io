    <td> This lesson I found out a three step process from my partner Charlie . His three step plan was really useful and it goes like this.When I am stuck, I use my brain first and try to persevere through the problem. Then, I ask the person next to me for help, in this case it can be either Charlie who is on my right, or Ben, who is on my left. After that, I google the answer, however I do not just get the answer, I also try to understand where I went wrong and also why the new code works better than before.When googled In will have the answer and work out how that answer was derived. This was great as it accelerated my progress greatly and I learnt lots more. I really enjoy these Python lessons because Python is a great tool that I can use later on in life.also, in year 9 we will be doing maya and that uses Python a lot, so learning the key skills early on will really help me when we come to do this. Here are the badges that I earnt the during the lesson:

    <td> This lesson's work was easier than last weeks and I worked well with nothing in my way so I will work the same as this lesson. Meaning that there was little that limited my learning and next lesson I wonâ€™t have to change my working pattern.</td>
