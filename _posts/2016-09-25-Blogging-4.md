make the background static while the information scrolls;  do something with the table to make it look less blocky; change the colour scheme.</td>

    <td>Much of what I did took a long time.  Once I had mastered each technical aspect of what I was doing, I spent a long time deliberating the aesthetic aspects of the site.  I am still uncertain that I have the look that I want.

Each new improvement led to me to research further.  How could I make lift the elements of the page with shadows; how could I change the shapes of the tables and containers; how could I add shading to the elements within the container; could I add shadows and gradients elsewhere? Do I still like my theme - are my colours working etc...</td>

    <td>Time is always the biggest limiting factor.  Much as I find all this stuff absorbing, my wife and children are less impressed.  I feel that my career as a web designer is being hampered by my family commitments… I think my wife would rather be a golf widow than a .scss widow!</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I'm still playing with the layout of the tables to make sure that everything flows nicely from a visual perspective.  I might change the headings to have a larger section explaining what it is that I am doing, with more space for elaboration into technical information.  That should be a fun read for all concerned! I think I’ll play around more with fonts next week.  Also, how can I get the date to right hand justify on my blogging titles?  Email me if you know...</td>
