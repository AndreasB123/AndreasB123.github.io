This lesson we focused on the python 3

At the beginning of the lesson we watched Mr.Keen text enhanced AI engines that were smart enough and coded well enough to seem as if they were real, there were tests on this. It was called MIsuki and the test Turimg test. Then we looked at how to make some AI ourselves, we included questions suchas: what is your name? And How are you? For our HW we had to make 3 more questions.
