My IT review

This year in IT has been an unexpected journey through 1s and 0s. I started learning how to code a robot arm and then I moved onto codecademy where I solved problems as I learned to fix code using Python. Mr. Keen, my teacher for half the term - also the one who set me this homework, has been an inspirational and such a wise figure during this year especially, he treats us with respect and as an adult because he trusts us to return that maturity. Not a single lesson of his has gone without my mind blown. He a role model and has increased my liking of the subject, recently he has opened my eyes to troubling and new scenarios that make you think and he also sets our paths and gives us hope.

Thank you Mr. Keen, 

For making my experience all the-more enjoyable.

Andreas
