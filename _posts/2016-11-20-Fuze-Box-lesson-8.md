    <td>At home before the lesson, I broke out my hotwires kit and started playing around with it to get some practice of electronics before the lesson.This definitely helped because it meant that I knew what I was doing in the lesson. In the lesson: Kriday and I started by reflecting on last lesson to see where we went wrong. In this case, it was  being more accurate when typing because we made a load of mistakes.  Me and kriday sat in a different place to last time so we didn't know where anything was but luckily, we quickly adapted to it and set up the fuze box. We then thought logically to set up the electronics kit and make a light bulb flash. When we ran into a problem, it was usually putting wire in the wrong place, this was easy to fix because we noticed where we went wrong and corrected our mistakes. Throughout the whole lesson, we persevered and ignored any distractions facing us. In the lesson we managed to not only make a light bulb light up but also change how much electricity is going to it to make it flash. It looked like this:

    <td>.I definitely learned a lot from Kriday because he has very high self belief , this means that he can persevere through sticky situations easily.  If I can do this is well it will make me a much better learner. My learning was limited this lesson because the workbook we had had really unclear instructions. The Fuze Box had so many little holes where you put the wires it was never clear where you ment to put it.</td>
