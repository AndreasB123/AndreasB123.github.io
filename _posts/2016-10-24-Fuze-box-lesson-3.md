    <td>Kriday and I used a lot of teamwork to help us solve problems. We were questioning things; asking : 'what would happen if we changed … ?‘. We were amazed at the accuracy in which you had to type thing. If you put extra punctuation in or even forget a capital letter, then the code doesn't work. In addition to this, we Reflected on last lesson and saw how we could improve. We then worked on that point during this lesson. For example, last lesson we needed to keep track of time and look at things at another angle. We did this by calling out when we had 45 mins left, 30 mins left, 15 mins left, 10 mins left, 5 mins left, 3 mins left, 2 mins left and finally 1 minute left. This helped us be more organised. We also looked at things from another angle when it said we had an error in our code. We couldn't find this error so we kept looking for different things and eventually found it. This lesson, we learnt about ‘strings' and how to ask a question using the ‘input’ command.</td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited because we were in a different room. This limited our learning because we would normally know where everything is,  but , in the new room we did not.
We need to work on self because when we get stuck and can't find an error we say ‘ I can’t do it’ when really, we can, we just didn't try hard enough</td>

    <td>Next time i will improve my learning by not wasting time at the beginning of the lesson by talking with my friends. Instead, me and kriday will set everything up straight away and get coding!</td>
