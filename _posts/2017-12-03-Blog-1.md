# **Google Sheets**

# **In our first I.C.T lesson of the academic year we started a new topic on google spreadsheets. We began by learning how to use the "sums" function (simple maths) . We learnt lots of the terminology for the actions and how to do basic sums between cells as well. Later on we were shown how you could use spreadsheets efficiently as if we were a (online) shop owner. We made our own shopping list with items, prices in the first two columns. In the third column we had the quantity and we created a sum which multiplied the quantity/amount by the price and by stretching that down all of our products - the programme recognised the pattern and did it for us.I vividly remember us learning how to create a search by - a such that you could type by letter and the price of that related product would appear in it's assigned box. **

**The code I used was ****=VLOOKUP(****G2****,****A2:B100****,****2****,****false****)**

**=VLOOKUP(G2 Is the box where you type in the word, hit enter and then where this code is written is where it appears (price).**

**,A2:B100 Is the data that google sheets looks at and finds the word and price associated with it. From columns A2 to (multiplied) B100 is the searched for area.**
