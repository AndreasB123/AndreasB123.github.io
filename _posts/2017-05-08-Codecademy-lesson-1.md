    <td>We started of the lesson by making an account on codecademy, a website which teaches you to code. We will be using the language python in this because it is commonly used and easy to understand. When we were stuck with a piece of code, I asked my friends around me to help, this worked well because it meant that we could collaborate together and achieve our goals quicker. Me and my friends didn't rush through the work at first, we took it slowly, got used to the program and tried to understand how things worked and also why. I got on to the date and time section of the programme this lesson!

    <td>Next time I will have more perseverance because when i got stuck, I went straight to my friends to help, I should've tried to think about it some more instead of interrupting them.</td>
