    <td>Kriday and I learnt by collaborating together and listening to each other. We also persevered and thought flexibly to work our way out of any problems we faced. We also applied past knowledge and made links  from when we did scratch to help and  understand how everything worked , and thus, improve our work. Moreover, we were noticing all of the small parts to everything looked at how they affected the bigger picture. This lesson, we learnt
The basics of B.A.S.I.C like the 'print command and the â€˜cycle' command. </td>

    <td>My learning was limited because of the lesson time; if it was longer we would of been able to whizz through the book and expand our knowledge. However, during the time we had in the lesson we didn't have  our learning limited. We need to work on keeping track of the time , because it is always useful to know how long you have left.</td>

    <td>Next time me and Kriday will improve our learning by trying some of the harder exercises to push and challenge ourselves. This will help us to learn more. Furthermore, if we get stuck, we need to look at things from another angle. This will help us solve the problem we are faced with.</td>
