    <td>Today in our it lesson we had mr keen teaching us. During the lesson we were talking about decompiling instructions. For  example, we were looking at how to make a cup of tea. We started  with "fill kettle up with water" but how do you do that? We then broke this up more so that we got, pick up kettle. Walk over to sink. Open lid with other hand ...etc...this is called decompiling. Another example is that we were told to stand up. We could do this easily. We were then told to stand up slowly. This time, we stood up, but you really need to think about what you are doing. We were then told to stand up with a straight back. Thus, was really hard because you had to really think about this. This relates back to computing because, if you do not make your code so civic enough. It will not do what you want. </td>
